            <p class="about-description">Hi, I'm Emily!</p>
            <p class="about-description">Writing About pages are a little like awkward first dates. You spend the first hour or so getting ready and trying to figure out how you want to introduce yourself.</p>
            <p class="about-description desc-quote">"Hello, nice to meet you." "What's up, bro, name's Emily." "Greetings, fellow human." "Uh, 404 error, sorry."</p>
            <p class="about-description">Eventually you settle on one, and you start thinking about all of the things you want to make sure they know about you before you step foot out of that restaurant.</p>
            <p class="about-description desc-quote">"I think strong communication is the most essential tool to being human." "I want to push myself and those around me to be better versions of themselves." "I believe there's nothing I can't do, and anyone who says otherwise clearly hasn't seen me work."</p>
            <p class="about-description">And, of course, you can't forget the most important part of getting to know any person - sharing your interests!</p>
            <p class="about-description desc-quote">"Virtual reality can change the future of education!" "Support refugee communities and give them the resources they also need to survive/thrive." "Where is your favorite place to go bouldering?" "Dogs? Dogs." "Don't judge me if I say I'm a Kirby and Dedede main."</p>
            <p class="about-description">As you munch on your food or sip on that coffee in a bit of awkward silence, you brainstorm some of the topics that are sure to spark a bit of warmth into the conversation.</p>
            <p class="about-description desc-quote">"My favorite people in the world are my little sisters." "We can use technology to transform the way we learn about the world and each other." "I'm inspired everyday by my parents, who endured genocide and immigration to give me a better life." "Have you heard this really great dad joke?"</p>
            <p class="about-description">Admittedly, I've never been that great at the whole first date thing, but it's a feature not a bug!</p>
